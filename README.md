# EXPLOG : Exploration Logger
EXPLOG is a modular and portable logging device that packs many embedded sensors. It can monitor and log various navigation and weather parameters such as accurate GPS location, direction, speed, acceleration, orientation, temperature, pressure, altitude, humidity, air quality, noise level, light intensity, and proximity simultaneously. The saved data can be exported to a computer or phone via USB, WiFi or BT and also an on-board LoRa transceiver allows for data sharing between devices and remote data acquisition. It can be used for research, fitness and sports performance analysis, and can function as a portable weather station and a surveillance device. 

The name is a wordplay on "exploration" and "logger". 

This project is under prototyping stage. I'm using ESP32 as the main controller. All the sensors are in the form of breakout modules for now. Once I complete the prototyping, I wish to make a custom PCB and a 3D printed case.
